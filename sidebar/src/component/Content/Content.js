        Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure
        and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy
        of the Uchiha clan, establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but
        also for future Uchiha to live up to.[17] His early childhood was marred
        by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon
        learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of
        Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the
        Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's
        actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi
        distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he
        murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan
        (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyo Sharingan, lit. "Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel
        Eye").[18][19][20] In reality, as Shisui possesses the ability to
        subliminally manipulate others and shares Itachi's love for the village,
        he intended to use his gift on the Uchiha clan leader to stop the coup
        d'état. However, Shisui is mortally wounded by the Leaf High Council
        member Danzo Shimura, who then takes his eye to achieve his own ideal of
        peace. When Shisui entrusts Itachi with his rediving eye, Itachi covers
        up Shisui's death to make it appear it was his doing. Eventually, in
        return for Danzo's offer to spare his younger brother, Itachi slaughters
        his entire clan.[21] After creating the misconception that he murdered
        their family in cold blood to give Sasuke the mindset to become strong
        enough to kill him once he is capable, Itachi leaves the village,
        although he warns Danzo not to harm Sasuke. Meeting up with Konoha's
        Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, who promises to do what he can to look
        after Sasuke, Itachi reveals his intentions to continue to protect the
        village from the shadows.[22] Soon after perceiving them as a threat to
        Konoha, Itachi joins the Akatsuki to ensure they do not endanger his
        village. Itachi becomes good friends with his partner Kisame Hoshigaki,
        who expresses concern for Itachi's wellbeing.[23] Itachi debuts in Part
        I after Hiruzen's death, when he uses his infiltration of Konoha to hunt
        down Naruto Uzumaki as an excuse to secretly check on Sasuke's
        wellbeing.[24] After engaging with Kakashi Hatake and some of Konoha's
        forces, he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki which are
        the people that contained the tailed beasts which there are nine of.
        Itachi also learns that Naruto is under the protection of Jiraiya and
        sets up a trap to lure the experienced ninja away to grab the
        boy.[23][25] However, as Jiraiya comes to Naruto's aid, Itachi finds
        himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back on the path of
        getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall
        back.[26][27] In Part II, Itachi uses one of Sasori's informants as a
        clone of himself to hold off Naruto and the rest of his team while he
        and the others seal away Shukaku the One Tail.[28] Itachi redivs on the
        sidelines until learning that Sasuke has finally severed his ties to
        Orochimaru, having absorbed him and now being strong enough to settle
        matters. Prior to his fight with Sasuke, Itachi meets with Naruto and,
        after questioning his intentions to save Sasuke, ensures the youth's
        safety with a crow with Shisui's Sharingan (写輪眼, lit. "Copy Wheel
        Eye", English manga: "Mirror Wheel Eye") as a countermeasure against
        Sasuke if he gains his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and attempts to attack
        Konoha.[29] Sasuke ultimately tracks him down and they engage in their
        final battle, during the course of which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan
        to push Sasuke to his limits. In doing so, Orochimaru is drawn out from
        Sasuke's body, and Itachi seals him away with his Totsuka blade before
        finally succumbing to his mysterious illness.[30] As his final act,
        Itachi implants his Amaterasu technique within Sasuke, meant as a
        protective measure that will kill Tobi in case he ever tries to approach
        Sasuke and reveal the truth of their clan's slaughter.[31]
        Unfortunately, having known where Itachi's loyalties truly lie, Tobi
        survived and reveals the truth of Itachi's actions to Sasuke. This gives
        Sasuke the resolve to destroy the village in revenge for ruining his
        brother's and his clan's lives, eventually having his brother's Mangekyo
        Sharingan implanted on him.[22] Itachi reappears later during the Fourth
        Great Ninja War, brought back by Kabuto Yakushi using the Reanimation
        Jutsu, a forbidden summoning jutsu that brings the dead back as immortal
        corpses, to fight on Tobi's side.[32] Paired with Nagato and forced to
        fight Naruto and Killer Bee against his will, Itachi learns of his
        brother's intentions and summons the crow he gave Naruto to regain his
        free will.[33] After sealing Nagato,[33] Itachi heads out to stop Kabuto
        and encounters Sasuke, with his younger brother wanting to know the
        truth once it is over.[34][35] After a long battle, Itachi is pushed to
        use Izanami to trap Kabuto in an eternal time-loop in his own mind, to
        have him break his jutsu.[36][37][38] His soul beginning to fade, Itachi
        uses his Sharingan to project his memories to Sasuke to reveal the full
        story of the events leading to the Uchiha Clan Massacre. Telling his
        brother that he does not have to forgive him, Itachi tells Sasuke that
        he will always love him, no matter what choice he makes from then
        on.[39] With his brother's parting words, and accepting defeat after his
        final battle with Naruto, Sasuke renounces destroying the village and
        devotes himself to protecting it, fulfilling Itachi's wish for his
        younger brother. Sasuke even adopts Itachi's habit of poking on the
        forehead as a sign of affection, which Sasuke does with his wife Sakura
        and their daughter Sarada Uchiha.[40][41] In other media Itachi is
        present in the sixth Naruto: Shippuden movie, Road to Ninja, where he
        leads an alternate-universe Akatsuki to help Naruto. He has a brief
        cameo in one of the original video animations, and is a playable
        character in nearly all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja
        series and the Ultimate Ninja series.[42][43][44][45][46][47] In some
        games, he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or
        manga.[48] Several merchandise items based on Itachi have been released,
        including key chains,[49] plush dolls,[50][51] and figurines.[52][53]
        Reception Itachi has ranked high in the Weekly Shonen Jump popularity
        polls for the series, continuously placing in the top 10.[6] He was
        ranked in fifth position in the polls of 2011, his highest ranking to
        date.[54] The character received generally positive reviews from several
        publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media. IGN
        reader Jason Van Horn characterized Itachi as "badass" and jokingly
        mentioned that he is a character to be afraid of since, in his first
        fight in the series, he does not make any remarkable move.[11] He found
        that "there is just something about the cold and numb Itachi," that
        makes the viewer "want to breakout in chills".[9] IGN's Charles White
        liked the episode where the relationship between young Sasuke and Itachi
        is revealed, and hoped to see more of their past to resolve the mystery
        of Itachi's character commenting that learning about their "past has
        been intriguing".[7] NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite
        black haired male anime character.[55] CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi
        Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from
        Naruto.[56] In the Shelf Life section from Anime News Network (ANN)
        Bamboo Dong comments that Itachi is one of her favorite characters from
        the series, noting his background and his introduction as the best parts
        of the series.[57] Activeanime writer Davey C. Jones celebrated Itachi's
        fights as the best ones in the series, noting his abilities to be as
        amazing as a "sci-fi ninja".[58] Holly Ellingwood from the same website
        agrees, citing his fight against Kakashi Hatake as one "few will be able
        to forget". The reviewer also praised Itachi's attitude, commenting that
        he "is as cold and as ruthless as any villain yet".[10] In a review of
        Volume 16 of the manga, Deb Aoki from About.com listed Itachi's
        introduction in the series as one of the cons from the volume. She
        praised his first fight in the series as very entertaining, meant to
        "whet readers' appetites for future fights between Konoha ninja and the
        Akatsuki".[59] James Musgrove commented that Itachi and his partner
        Kisame "make a dramatic and well-timed entrance into the story".[60]
        However, Jason Van Horn criticised the first battle between Itachi and
        Sasuke, as "good" but not "as epic as it should've been".[61] His last
        fight with Sasuke before dying was considered "epic" by Casey Brienza
        from ANN. She found it to be "a battle of minds" since, even after
        Itachi's death, Sasuke changes his mind about him when he learns about
        his past. She also anticipated the impact of Itachi's past revelations
        on the future storyline of Naruto.[8] Despite disliking how the anime
        Shippuden used Itachi's light novel as part of the series, Chris
        Beveridge from the Fandom Post enjoyed Itachi's impact on both Sasuke
        and Naruto.[62] Writer Jason Thompson highly praised his visual
        tortures, due to the effect it has on the victims, reminding him of the
        antagonist from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's film Cure notable for its horror
        scenes. Nevertheless, he criticized Itachi's death scene as a result of
        his disease rather than being killed by Sasuke, taking all the blame
        from his brother in the process.[63] In 2014, IGN listed him as the
        fifth best Naruto character when the series ended.[64]
